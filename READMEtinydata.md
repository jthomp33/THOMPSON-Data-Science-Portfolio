# 2008 Olympics Medal Analysis: Tidy Data Triumphs! 🥇🥈🥉

Welcome to a fun and engaging exploration of the 2008 Olympics medal distribution! In this Jupyter Notebook, we'll dive into the data, applying the principles of tidy data to reveal fascinating insights. Let's get ready to cheer for tidy data!

## Project Overview: Achieving Data Gold 🏆

Our goal is to analyze the medal distribution from the 2008 Olympics using tidy data principles. We'll discover which sports awarded the most medals and examine the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals across the games. By tidying our data, we'll make it easier to manipulate, model, and visualize, just as Hadley Wickham intended!

**What is Tidy Data?**

Remember, tidy data has three key rules:

1.  Each variable forms a column.
2.  Each observation forms a row.
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Following these rules will help us transform our messy dataset into a champion!

## Instructions: Your Olympic Journey 🗺️

Ready to start your data exploration? Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Download this notebook and the dataset to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Use pip to install them:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Open the Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `olympics_08_medalists.ipynb`.
4.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially to witness the data wrangling magic!

## Dataset Description: From Beijing to Tidy 🐉

Our dataset, `olympics_08_medalists.csv`, contains medal distribution data from the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Here's a quick overview:

* **Source:** Download it to from my portfolio!
* **Content:** Medalists' names, sport, gender, and medal type.
* **Pre-processing:** We'll perform several tidy data transformations, including:
    * Melting the data from wide to long format.
    * Splitting the `sport_gender` column into separate `gender` and `sport` columns.
    * Cleaning sport names by removing unwanted characters.
    * Handling missing values by dropping rows where no medal was awarded.
    * Reordering columns for better structure.
