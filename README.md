# 🚧 **Welcome to My GitHub Worksite!** 🚧  
### **🏗️ Building a Better Future, One Project at a Time**  
Hi there! 👋 This repository is where I break ground on exciting data science projects and pave the way for insights and solutions. It's a construction zone, so don’t mind the dust—there's always something in progress!  

---

## 🔨 **Purpose of This Repository**  
This repository serves as the foundation of my **Data Science Portfolio**. From exploratory data analysis to model building, you’ll find everything here as I construct, refine, and showcase my data skills throughout the semester and beyond! 

---

## 🏢 **Future Projects: Organization Blueprint**  
Here’s the layout for how my future projects will be organized:  
- **📁 `EDA/`**: Foundation-level work—cleaning and exploring data - hopefully this will be of itnerst to some of you. 
- **📁 `Visualizations/`**: Probably my favorite part - making the data look pretty and communicable.  
- **📁 `Models/`**: The heavy machinery—machine learning and statistical models.  
- **📁 `Documentation/`**: The user manual—write-ups and analyses explaining the work.

## 🚜 **Work in Progress**  
This portfolio is an active construction zone, where I’m experimenting, building, and refining projects in real time. Here are two current highlights that show where I’m heading:

- 📊 **Tiny Data Project**  
  This project takes a small classroom dataset and walks through the full pipeline: cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data. I created bar charts and grouped scatter plots to make the dataset easier to understand and more compelling to present. Though simple, this project is practice for applying these skills to larger, more complex data in the future.

- 🤖 **Intro to Machine Learning App**  
  This is an interactive Streamlit app that lets users upload a CSV file and apply unsupervised machine learning models like K-means clustering and PCA. It includes dynamic charts, model tuning controls, and the ability to compare visualizations across models. The project helps me learn both machine learning logic and user-facing design — a key goal as I build toward applied data science.
