### **🏗️ Building a Better Future, One Project at a Time**  
Hi there! 👋 This repository is where I break ground on exciting data science projects and pave the way for insights and solutions. It's a construction zone, so don’t mind the dust—there's always something in progress!  

---

## 🔨 **Purpose of This Repository**  
This repository serves as the foundation of my **Data Science Portfolio**. From exploratory data analysis to model building, you’ll find everything here as I construct, refine, and showcase my data skills throughout the semester and beyond! 

---

## 🏢 **Future Projects: Organization Blueprint**  
Here’s the layout for how my future projects will be organized:  
- **📁 `EDA/`**: Foundation-level work—cleaning and exploring data - hopefully this will be of itnerst to some of you. 
- **📁 `Visualizations/`**: Probably my favorite part - making the data look pretty and communicable.  
- **📁 `Models/`**: The heavy machinery—machine learning and statistical models.  
- **📁 `Documentation/`**: The user manual—write-ups and analyses explaining the work.

## 🚜 **Work in Progress**  
Stay tuned as I continue adding more projects and enhancing this repository. It’s all part of the plan to construct a top-tier portfolio!  
One project that I am working on is my tine data project (found here: https://github.com/jthomp33/THOMPSON-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/TinyDataProject.ipynb) This takes some data from my class and makes, cleans it up and makes it into some cool visualizations. This is just some proactice, but I hope to be bale to use it for larger and more comprehnesive data sets to produce some really compelling graphs. 
I also am developing another new app making my intorduction into Machine Learning! This hosws some introduction to using python for machine learning, allows me to practice some skills for client facing development. This app compliments my portfolio by devloping some app-creation technique, building on making things more visually interesting as well as emplys new strategies that I am excited for you all to see. This allows users to upload their own data or use a data set and see some cool visualizations and evaluate their accuracy - feel free to check it out here: https://github.com/jthomp33/THOMPSON-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/MLSTREAMLITAPP.py
