### **🏗️ Building a Better Future, One Project at a Time**  
Hi there! 👋 This repository is where I break ground on exciting data science projects and pave the way for insights and solutions. It's a construction zone, so don’t mind the dust—there's always something in progress!  

---

## 🔨 **Purpose of This Repository**  
This repository serves as the foundation of my **Data Science Portfolio**. From exploratory data analysis to model building, you’ll find everything here as I construct, refine, and showcase my data skills throughout the semester and beyond!

## 🚜 **Work in Progress**  
This portfolio is an active construction zone, where I’m experimenting, building, and refining projects in real time. Here are a few current highlights that show where I’m heading:

### 📊 Tiny Data Project  
This project takes a small classroom dataset and walks through the full pipeline: cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data. I created bar charts and grouped scatter plots to make the dataset easier to understand and more compelling to present. Though simple, this project is practice for applying these skills to larger, more complex data in the future.

### 🤖 Intro to Machine Learning App  
This was my first end-to-end machine learning deployment project. I built a Streamlit app that lets users upload a CSV file and apply classification or regression models, including performance metrics like accuracy and ROC curves. It laid the groundwork for thinking about model interpretability and user experience in applied machine learning.

### 🌐 Unsupervised Machine Learning Explorer — *New!*  
This interactive Streamlit app is designed to help users experiment with unsupervised machine learning techniques like **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **PCA**. Users can upload datasets or use built-in examples, tune hyperparameters, and instantly visualize clustering outcomes and reduced dimensions.

This project deepened my understanding of **unsupervised learning logic** and how to create usable, responsive apps that make abstract ML concepts tangible. It also sharpened my ability to **deploy real-time tools** with interactive front-ends and useful model diagnostics—strengthening the core theme of this portfolio: bridging technical skill with accessible design.
